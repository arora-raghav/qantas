# Qantas Technical Assignment

Qantas technical assignment project with Cypress installation instructions.

## Getting Started

Follow the setup procedure to get the Cypress end-to-end testing framework up and running. Estimated time 5min.

# Set up

Start your local server before testing with Cypress

## Install Cypress
```
$ cd /your/project/path

$ npm init

$ npm install cypress --save-dev
```

## Copy this repository to your machine
```
$ git clone https://github.com/arora-raghav/qantas.git

$ cd Web_automation
```
## Start Cypress test runner
```
$ npm run cypress:open
```
The test runner should open

## How to run the tests

$ npm run cypress:run

## Assignment solution approach

I chose to use the Cypress framework using JavaScript as the language for both Weather API Testing as well as UI testing of PHPTravels. 

## Meeting assignment requirements
- JavaScript was used as the programming language of choice
- Tests are executed using the Cypress desktop app to allows execution of tests
- Tests are written to follow Cypress best practice.
